Why is a stack the right choice for undo/redo?
Stack is the right choice for undo/redo because of the principle of Last In First Out, this means that the last value that
the last value added into the stack will be the first one to be modified (undo/redo). Using stacks helps to maintain the order becoming easier to manage.
Why is a queue better suited for the help desk?
Queue is better because insted of being LIFO, it's going to be FIFO. This means First In First Out, this means that the first value that
the first value added into the queue will be the first one to be modified. In the help desk case you need to modify the first person in queue
because you need to help the first person to get to the desk.
How do your implementations differ from Pythonâ€™s built-in lists?
This node implementation of stack and queue allows faster modification. If you used Python's built-in lists you would need to access elements by index
and it would make less efficient and slower.
